# Week 01 - Introduction

## Java Flow

1. .java
2. .class
3. JVM
4. Executable code

## Pros of Java

- Popular in Hong Kong
- Less complicated that C++
- Type safe (all variables require types to be declared)
- OOP
- Multi-threading

## How to Read Java

```java
public class HelloWorld {
		public static void mai(String[] args) {
      
    }
}
```

public - access modifier: to determine permission level 

- public: available to all
- private: within a class
- protected: within a class and subclasses
- default: less common - package level access
- And some more new modifiers after Java 11



class, interface, enum



Hello world is the name



Void - return type

void: return nothing



main method - entry point of the main program



args - for passing arguements into a method



Command for terminal

javac - to compile

java - to execute

## Static or Non-static





## Primitive Types

8 things that prevented Java to be completely OOP

- integer 2^31 - 64bit
	- integer cache can be defined
	- -128 to 127 by default
- string
- character
- boolean
- short
- float
- long
- double



## What to improve

- Still convered my uncovered concepts before moving on
	- i.e. used for loop before talking about it
	- didn't cover the absolute basis
- Topics are jumping around
-
